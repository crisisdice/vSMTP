# vsmtp-plugin-ldap

A plugin for vSMTP that implements a bridge to ldap databases.

It is highly recommended that you check out the [ldap primer](https://github.com/inejge/ldap3/blob/ba627b409afcdced737aa758a821f4c8b3447597/LDAP-primer.md) from the [ldap3](https://github.com/inejge/ldap3) Rust crate if you do want to get an introduction to the protocol.
